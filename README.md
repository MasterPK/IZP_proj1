# IZP Project 1

Simple program that will find city (or part of it) in list.

## How to use:

Program is tested on Debian, but works well on all Linux distributions. Windows compatibility is not guaranteed!
It's CLI based.

In file `adresy.txt` are cities. You can edit it.

Example:

`./proj1 Br <adresy.txt`

Expected output is: 

```
Found: BR
Enable: ANU
```
